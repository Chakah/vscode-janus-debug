## Changelog

You'll find a complete list of changes at our project site on [GitHub](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug).

### 0.0.6

TODO

### 0.0.5 (2017-06-02)

Most notable in this release: We have merged _vscode-documents-scripting_ and _vscode-janus-debug_ extensions into one single extension. Users do not need to install multiple extensions anymore to get the full experience. We hope that this makes development much easier and faster.

Lots of bugs have been fixed in this release:

  - Setting breakpoints is more reliable now ([#12](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/12)). Thanks to [ChDxterWard](https://github.com/ChDxterWard).
  - Fixed problems with encrypted and decrypted scripts. The encryption states are now read from DOCUMENTS server prior to every upload. The `// #crypt` entry in a script should work now as expected.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented connecting the debugger to a DOCUMENTS 5 server ([#23](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/23)). Sorry!

### 0.0.4 (2017-05-17)

This release includes two important bug fixes that make creating a launch.json file and connecting to a remote server much more reliable.

### 0.0.3 (2017-05-08)

No big changes. Timeouts are configurable via launch.json now.

### 0.0.2 (2017-03-22)

Initial release of the extension. Running and debugging simple scripts directly from within VS Code on a JANUS-based server works! ðŸŽ‰
